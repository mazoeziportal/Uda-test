The gRpc docuemtnation for location-event-producer
The request has a payload with userId,latitude, and longitude.

To make a sample request,please refer to the modules/location-event-producer/main.py 

This main.py file is ready to send a request to location-event-producer service deployed into kubernetes through gRPC

The location data must follow  the following structured data transportation i.e protocol buffers (protobuf)-> location.proto


message LocationMessage {

  int32 userId = 1;
  int32 latitude = 2;
  int32 longitude = 3;

}

service locationService {
  rpc Create(LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}



The gRPC server is hosted by the 'location-event-producer' microservice on port 5005.

A sample gRPC client 'writer.py' has been provided in the 'location-event-producer' microservice to illustrate sending location data to the location ingester.


To test, run the following commands:

'''
export LOCATION_EVENT_PRODUCER_POD=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "service=udaconnect-location-event-prod-api" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

kubectl exec -it $LOCATION_EVENT_PRODUCER_POD sh
'''

Once you are inside the shell, execute the grpc client with the command below:

'''
python writer.py
'''
